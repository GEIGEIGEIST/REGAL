REGAL is a 14 key (actually 11 keys and three pushbuttons) and one encoder keyboard meant to be used as macropad on the back of a tablet or phone. I designed it to work with the Samstung Galaxy Tab S7 FE, but you can probably use it with a variety of devices. 
It attaches to the device through magnets and uses Kailh Choc Minis and Chosfox CFX keycaps.
